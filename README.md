# Demo Objectives 

## Use Case 

This demo showcases best practices for building an AI-driven, agentic virtual assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with watsonx Orchestrate.

To illustrate these principles, the demo follows a narrative centered on employees managing the travel and expense process at a fictional company called RAGNova:

- User: Plans a business trip, including booking a hotel.
- Governance Officer: Oversees the virtual assistant, ensuring it mitigates challenges such as hallucinations and potential misuse.
